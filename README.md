# SWATMobileAssignment

Hi Mr.Vincent,

I had answer the assignment that you gave and the question I had choosed is Question 2 & 3.

For the question 2, I had choose python language to answer it, which is read json as input, using the Quay API to perform SecScan and produce a .json as result. 

For the question 3, I had created a terraform configuration script in order to manage the team in the Github. 


Best regards,
Oscar.
